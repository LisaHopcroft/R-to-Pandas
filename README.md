# R-to-Pandas

I'm a long time R user moving to Python. This repo compiles some useful examples
that demonstrate the equivalent Pandas functionality for R tidyverse/ggplot2
functionality.

The examples are contained within the same Markdown files, using
[{reticulate}](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate) to run Python within the R
environment.
